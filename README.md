# Inflation Analysis
 R scripts for reading in and analyzing CPI inflation data from the BLS's text website.
 
 File 1_load_cpi_data reads the latest data from the BLS website, cleans it up, attaches a weights file, and saves it.
 This data is updated monthly, within minutes of the CPI numbers coming out. Once run, it doesn't need to be rerun
 until the next month to incorporate new data.
  
 File 2_load_helper_functions gives some functions, themes, and inflation analysis baskets, I use. Not necessary, but helpful.
 
 File 3 and 4 are beta versions of code that summarize monthly data releases as soon as they happen, to give a snapshot of what is occuring.
